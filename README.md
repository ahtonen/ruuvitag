# ruuvitag
A ruuvitag is a weatherproof, battery powered sensor which reports temperature, humidity, pressure and motion via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. This repo shows how to define Ruuvitags to listen and write their values to AWS Timestream.

Just click the button, create or sign-in to your balenaCloud account, add your device and start sending Ruuvitag data!

## Balena device configuration

Each device must have these environment variables set. First defines RuuviTag MACs to listen and second their aliases.
```
RUUVITAG_MACS_TO_LISTEN=['ED:BD:47:DA:64:D4', 'C9:50:B1:7D:A8:8F']
RUUVITAG_MAC_ALIASES={'ED:BD:47:DA:64:D4': 'sauna', 'C9:50:B1:7D:A8:8F': 'outside'}
```
Setting first variable to `[]` means listening all MACs.
